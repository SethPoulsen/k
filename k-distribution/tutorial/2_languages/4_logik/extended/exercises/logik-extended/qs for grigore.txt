questions: 

WTH is this "SemanticCastToTerm????"

In the extended syntax, why can't predicates be nested inside of predicates? 

WTH is #renameVariables, #variablesMap, #variables, and #unifiable?

Vals is not a child of anything else in the syntax...how is anything ever going to parsed as a Val????
